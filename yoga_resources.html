                        <h3>What Is Yoga?</h3>
                        <div class="img"><img src="images/yoga.avif" alt="Yoga"></div>
                        <p>
                            Yoga is a holistic practice that originated in ancient India and has evolved over thousands of years.
                            It encompasses physical postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), meditation,
                            and ethical principles aimed at harmonizing the body, mind, and spirit. While yoga offers numerous physical benefits,
                            such as improved flexibility, strength, and balance, its true essence lies in fostering mental clarity, emotional well-being,
                            and spiritual growth. Through mindful movement, breath awareness, and self-reflection, practitioners cultivate a deeper connection with 
                            themselves and the world around them, ultimately seeking union (yoga) between the individual self and the universal consciousness. 
                        </p>

                        <h3>Yoga For Beginners</h3>
                        <div class="img"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D-bDA4lo2mc?si=EQakOEY7MfEpkum2" title="YouTube video player"

                        <p>
                            As a beginner, it's natural to feel a mix of excitement and uncertainty. Remember, yoga is a personal journey, and there's no need to rush.
                            Take your time to explore and discover what feels right for you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Yoga is more than just physical movement; it's also about breath awareness and mindfulness. Pay attention to your breath as you move through each pose, 
                            allowing it to guide and anchor you in the present moment. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Be gentle with yourself as you navigate your practice. Embrace the sensations in your body without judgment, and don't be afraid to make modifications 
                            or take breaks as needed. Remember, there's no competition or comparison in yoga—only self-discovery and growth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Above all, approach your practice with an open heart and a curious mind. Each time you step onto your mat, you have the opportunity to connect with yourself 
                            on a deeper level, to cultivate compassion and gratitude, and to find moments of peace amidst life's chaos.
                        </p>

                                    <b>Yoga Mat:</b> A good-quality yoga mat provides cushioning and grip, making it easier to maintain balance and stability during poses.
                                    Look for a mat that is durable, non-slip, and comfortable for your hands and feet. Brands like Manduka, Liforme, and Jade Yoga offer high-quality mats suitable for beginners. 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Yoga Blocks:</b> Yoga blocks are helpful for modifying poses and providing support,
                                    especially for beginners who may need assistance in reaching the floor or maintaining proper alignment. 
                                    They can also be used to deepen stretches and improve flexibility. Opt for lightweight foam blocks or cork blocks for stability.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Yoga Strap:</b> A yoga strap is useful for extending reach and improving flexibility,
                                    particularly in poses where the hands cannot easily reach each other or the feet.
                                    It can also assist in maintaining proper alignment. Choose a sturdy strap with a D-ring or buckle for easy adjustment.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Yoga Towel:</b> A yoga towel can be placed over your mat to absorb sweat and improve grip, especially during hot yoga or vigorous practices. 
                                    Look for a non-slip, absorbent towel that is machine washable for convenience.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Yoga Blanket:</b> A yoga blanket can be used for additional cushioning and support during seated poses, 
                                    as well as for warmth during relaxation at the end of practice. Look for a soft, durable blanket made from natural fibers like cotton or wool.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                <b>Water Bottle:</b> Staying hydrated is essential during yoga practice, so having a reusable water bottle nearby is important.
                                    Choose a bottle that is easy to grip and spill-proof, preferably made from BPA-free materials.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                        <h3>Types Of Poses</h3>
                        <p>Yoga has various pose types based on how you move your body to complete them. Here are the basic types of yoga poses.</p>
                        <div class="img"><img src="images/poses_types.avif" alt="Types of Poses"></div>
                        <p>
                            <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
                                <li>
                                    <b>Standing poses:</b> Standing poses are often done first in a yoga class to "build heat" and warm you up. In vinyasa/flow style yoga, 
                                    standing poses are strung together to form long sequences. In Hatha classes, you may do the standing poses individually with rest between each pose.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Balancing poses:</b> Beginners' balances are an important way to build the core strength necessary for many of yoga's more advanced postures. 
                                    Though balances may seem difficult at first, you will find that you can improve markedly with regular practice.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Backbends:</b> As a beginner, you will generally begin with gentle spine flexion and extension, eventually moving to deeper bends.
                                    Since you rarely move like this in daily life, backbends are essential for spinal health and longevity.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Seated poses:</b> Seated stretches, which often focus on stretching the hips and hamstrings, are usually done toward the end of a yoga class after the body is warm.
                                    Placing a folded yoga blanket or a block under your seat is an excellent way to make yourself more comfortable in these postures.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Resting or supine poses:</b> It's essential to get to know your resting poses, especially child's pose, which you are encouraged to do whenever you need a break during a yoga session.
                                    These resting poses continue the hip and hamstring work of the seated poses and provide gentle back-bending, twisting, and inversion.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                        <h3>Downward Facing Dog (Adho Mukha Svanasana)</h3>
                        <p><b>Pose type: Standing</b></p>
                        <div class="img"><img src="images/pose1.jpg" alt="Adho Mukha Svanasana"></div>
                         <p>
                            Downward Facing Dog goes hand in hand with yoga, but just because you've heard of this pose doesn't mean it's easy to do.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Beginners often lean too far forward in this posture, making it more like a plank. 
                            Instead, remember to keep your weight mostly in your legs and reach your hips high, with your heels stretching toward the floor (they do not need to touch the floor).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Bend your knees a little to facilitate the move if you have tight hamstrings. Keep feet parallel.

                        <h3>Mountain Pose (Tadasana)</h3>
                        <p><b>Pose type: Standing</b></p>
                        <div class="img"><img src="images/pose2.png" alt="Tadasana"></div>
                        <p>
                            Mountain pose may not be as famous as Downward Facing Dog, but it is equally important. This is an excellent time to talk about alignment, which is how your body parts are ideally arranged in each pose.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The alignment in Mountain pose draws a straight line from the crown of your head to your heels, with the shoulders and pelvis stacked along the line. Every person's body is different, so focus on rooting down with your feet and lengthening up with your spine.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A yoga teacher can talk you through this in class, reminding you to slide your shoulders down your back and keep weight on your heels.

                        <p>
                            The critical thing to remember in Warrior I is that the hips face forward. Think of your hip points as headlights—they should be roughly parallel with the front of your mat. This may require you to take a wider stance.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Unlike Warrior I, in Warrior II, the hips face the side of the mat. The hips and shoulders open to the side when moving from Warrior I to Warrior II.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You'll also rotate your back foot, angling your toes at about 45 degrees. In both Warrior poses, aim to keep your front knee stacked over the ankle. Your front toes face forward.

                            One modification of Extended Side Angle Pose is to bring your forearm to your thigh instead of placing your hand on the floor. It should rest lightly on your thigh and not bear much weight. 
                            This modification enables you to keep your shoulders open. You can also place your hand on a yoga block.
